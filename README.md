A machine learning system that predicts detailed cost breakdowns for fashion products based on fabric type, brand tier, and selling price.

## Features

- **Cost Prediction**: Estimates manufacturing costs from selling price
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows fabric, manufacturing, transport, tax, and brand value costs
- **Multiple Categories**: Supports 7 fabric types and 4 brand tiers
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command line interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdsvr/Cost-Analysis-in-Textile-Production-Using-AI.git
   cd fashion-cost-predictor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model
Run the Jupyter notebook to train and save the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook fashion_cost_model_training.ipynb
```

### Making Predictions
Run the predictor script:
```bash
python fashion_predictor.py
```

Example session:
```
=== Fashion Cost Predictor ===

Available Fabric Types: cotton, silk, wool, linen, leather, denim, fleece
Available Brand Tiers: budget, mid_range, premium, luxury

Enter fabric type: silk
Enter brand tier: premium
Enter product type: Evening Gown  
Enter selling price (₹): 5000

================== COST BREAKDOWN ==================

Predicted Selling Price: ₹5,000.00

Cost Components:
- Fabric: ₹1,750.00
- Manufacturing: ₹1,250.00  
- Transport: ₹250.00
- Tax: ₹500.00
- Brand Value: ₹1,250.00
